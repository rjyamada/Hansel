# Group Project - Hansel

Inspired by the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel">Hansel and Gretel</a>, Hansel is an android app that allows users to automatically track user's gelocations over time and share with others.  It is most useful in a situation where internet connectivity is unstable and/or limited for one or more members in the group.

## General use cases
- As a person who lost his/her friends at an outdoor concert event and can't reach them via phone calls or messages, I want to trace the locations where my friends were recently spotted by the app.  
- As a person who wants to meet up with friends, I want to share my geolocation and recent path with others.
- As a person who is coordinating multiple activities inside a theme park, I want to see and track different groups.

## Core User Stories
- User should be able to add members
- User should be able to see his/her own geolocation logs
- User should be able to see members' geolocation logs
- User should be able to see members' current locations on a map
- User should be able to see and traverse through member's recent paths on a map
- User should be able to enable/disable location tracking
- User should be able to see the status of location upload (e.g. pending, sent)

## "Nice to have" User Stories
- User should be able to create multiple groups
- Transfer information to others without using internet (something similar to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opengarden.firechat&hl=en">Fire chat</a>)
